    <summary> My Childhood </summary>
      <p>
      I grew up in <strong> Singapore</strong>. I am fortunate enough to be born into a upper middle
      class household. Through the helicopter parenting that I received,
      <em>I had a busy childhood </em> filled with a myriad of experiences - from playing
      sports to studying shapes to attending piano lessons - which I would be eternally
      grateful for.
