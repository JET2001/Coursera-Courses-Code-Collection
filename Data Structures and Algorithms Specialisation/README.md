## Specialisation Content
### Course 1 - Algorithmic Toolbox 
This course covers, broadly, the different types of approaches to solving an algorithmic problem.
- Fibonacci Numbers
- Greatest Common Divisor
- Big-O Notation
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming 

### Course 2 - Data Structures
This course covers basic data structures used throughout the rest of the specialisation.
- Arrays and Linked lists.
- Queues and stacks 
- Dynamic Arrays and Amortised analysis
- Disjoint sets
