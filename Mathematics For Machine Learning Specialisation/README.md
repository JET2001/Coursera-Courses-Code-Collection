- Relationship between machine learning, linear algebra, vectors and matrices.
- Finding the size of a vector, its angle and projection, Changing the Reference Frame, Doing some real-world vector examples
- Introduction to Matrices, Matrix Inverses, Special Matrices and Coding up some Matrix Operations
- Matrices as objects that map one vector onto another,  Matrices transform into new basis vector set, Making Multiple Mappings,  Recognising Mapping Matrices and applying these to data.
- Eigenvectors, PageRank Algorithm

### Course 2 - Multivariate Calculus
