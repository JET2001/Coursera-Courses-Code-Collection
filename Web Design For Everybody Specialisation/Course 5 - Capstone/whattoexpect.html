    <summary> What To Expect From Lessons with Me? <span><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-2x"></i></span></summary>
    <p>
      I enjoy Mathematics and the study of it in Singapore.
      You can argue that it is because I am good at it,
      but I have taught many of my classmates throughout the years in school
      and helped them grasp concepts which they never thought they could.
      This ability to help my peers in the past has given me the confidence to believe that
      I can help you with Mathematics during the
      two years of teaching you part-time.<br><br>

      I am a curious person who enjoys the art of exploratory learning.
      When I explain concepts, I attempt to bring together many different ideas
      and ask questions that will trigger insight and deepen understanding.
      These questions aided me during my period of study,
      which may get a bit too mentally exhausting at times.
      However, I am cognisant that for tuition in small groups in an informal
      setting is targeted to the calibres of the individual or individuals,
      and I promise to fulfil this primary purpose before I attempt to expand
      the mathematical horizons of the already unwilling.<br><br>

      We all know this – that students who just graduated and now are giving
      tuition to their juniors who need it – cannot charge high hourly rates.
      It is, arguably, the best value of money for you vis-a-vis going to some
      official tuition centre outside. But perhaps a more robust incentive for
      tuition by ex-students aside from this economic lobang would be that we,
      the students of yesterday, would be the most effective in conveying
      concepts and ideas, motivation and encouragement to you or your child,
      whom we ultimately treat as a peer or a friend.<br><br>

        I am generally open to both private or group size (size &#8804; 4) tuition. However,
        it is worthy to note the difference in purpose between the two: <br><br>

        Private tuition: Private tuition is necessary if you or your child
         is performing significantly behind their peers. The benefits of such
         would be (a) undivided attention, (b) customised tutoring. However,
         this may produce dependency on the tutor and may affect the speed of
         the class.I would only recommend private tuition if you plan to get
         tuition close to your examinations or if you are falling behind in class.
         <br><br>
        Group Size (Size &#8804; 4) tuition: Especially in Mathematics, small group tuition helps allow
         students to (a) engage in healthy competition with their peers, and it
         (b) generates a more lively class with group discussions. Most
         importantly, in the long run, it will allow you to be more independent
         in your learning which is necessary for a subject like Mathematics.<br><br>
