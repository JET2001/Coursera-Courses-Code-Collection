      <p class = "intro_" id = "intro_"> So yes, my name is Jonathan. I am an alumnus of Dunman High School
        and have studied in the Integrated Programme. I have a deep interest in Mathematics,
        and an inquisition which helped grow my interest in it when I learnt more about the
        interconnectedness of the topics in higher education.
        I am extremely new to this tuition thingy basically, but after many years of being
        one of the more popular consultants of math questions by my peers in school has given
        me an intangible experience of explaining and rationalising concepts with people of
        differing aptitudes in Mathematics.<br>

      <p id = "purpose_">
        I intend to teach Mathematics to Secondary School students and students in Junior College
        (Lower Secondary Math (S1-S2), E Math(S3-S4), A Math (S3-S4),
        Mathematics at H1 or H2 Level (JC)), of differing levels of calibre. I don't mind teaching
        Physics or Chemistry as well, but I personally feel that I cannot give as much insight as I can
        with Mathematics. <br> <br>
        As for the period that I intend to teach, I aim to teach part-time from
        December 2020 to November 2022, at an hourly rate which I will discuss with you in person
        (but come on, I'm just starting out, how expensive can it be right? HAHA). <br>

        Possibly the least important section of all, but at the same time it is arguably the only
        universally recognisable metric that I have at this point that I have been getting stellar
        results for math throughout my years in school. But just for formality and legitimacy purposes,
        here are my grades for the more significant examinations in my secondary and JC years.
